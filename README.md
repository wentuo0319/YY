# ðŸ‘‹ Hello developer!

This is a PHP with Laravel web framework project template. Check our [tutorials for frontend development](https://www.w3schools.com/where_to_start.asp) to learn the basics of [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp and [PHP](https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp). You can also learn the fundamental concepts of the Laravel framework by referring to its official documentation available at https://laravel.com/docs.

## Knowledge requirements

To be able to fully understand and modify this project, you should know (or learn):

PHP programming language
Laravel web framework
Blade templating engine

## ðŸ”¨ What's next?

Customize this project to make it your own. Implement new features, modify existing ones, or integrate it with other technologies.

## ðŸŽ¨ Where to find everything?

The project is structured as follows:

app folder contains the project's source code.
public folder contains the static resources (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript files).
resources/views folder contains the Blade templates.
w3s-dynamic-storage/.env contains the application properties.
composer.json contains application dependencies.

### Database

Dynamic spaces can use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html) database.  
The database file is called `database.db`. It is placed inside the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder.  
SQLite connection path to the database is `w3s-dynamic-storage/database.db` which you can use to connect to the SQLite database programmatically.
Example can be found in database folder.

---

**Do not change the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder name or `database.db` file name!**  
**By changing the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder name or `database.db` file name, you risk the space not working properly.**

## ðŸ”¨ Please note

For now, files created/uploaded or edited from within the terminal view will not be backed up or synced.
When you're in the editor, the dev server will automatically be running and any changes you make will automatically restart the app.
